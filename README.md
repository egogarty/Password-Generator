# Password-Generator
A password generator is a crucial tool for ensuring unauthorized access to websites or portals, as it prevents misuse of information or identity theft. A strong password consists of lowercase, uppercase, symbols, and digits, with a suitable length being above 10 characters. The Python implementation of a password generator project uses random and tkinter modules, making it suitable for beginners.

The project requires no extra installation of modules, and the module is predefined. Tkinter is already available on your system, so you can reinstall it or use the command "sudo apt-get install python3-tkinter" to install it.

To build the password generator, import random and tkinter modules, define the password generator function, define a character string, create a user interface, add input widgets, and call the translate function. The project file structure includes the import random and tkinter modules, define a password generator function, define a character string, create a user interface, and add input widgets.

The user interface is defined using Tk(), which handles user events and widgets. The application's dimensions are defined in the format lengthxbreadth, and the title is set as an optional parameter. The input widgets include a title, length, width, repeat, and repetition labels. The app's widgets can be customized to fit the user's preferences and preferences.
